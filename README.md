# 3DMP
Everything that is in this repo was design using fusion360 and sliced by prusa slicer

Each "homework %i" folder contains the i-th project
-.f3d fusion 360 project
-.stl the file to be sliced
-there are also images of the sliced, ready-to-be-printed of the stl in each folder

.....
Folder No Fall Mechanism has the final project
I've chosen this mechanism because I find the concept very intrigue.
it works by having a third wheel that assure it won't fall.
The main components are Chasis, BackMechanism and FrontPart

Scoooter Project

The following project represents a classic Scooter. I have chosen this project it details fundamental concepts of bounding components and bodies togheter.

There are 3 main components and 1 bounding component. The HandleBar rotates with the clam and the clam rotates with the fork, and they are bounded by the clam. The clam is positioned on top of the deck's tube. The deck servers as origin for the other components (to know in which direction should the components rotate) and therefore is grounded. The wheel in the back rotates independently from other.

The joint that powers the rotation of the components (expect the back wheel) is Rotation HandleBar with Deck.

The project contains the following file types:
.png - representing the canvases and renders. It is also used for slicing example (in prusa slicer)
.mp4 - representing the video render of the motion study
.f3d - representing the project file
.stl - represents the components of the scouter that can be 3dprinted (obs. Scooter.stl is the stl file of the whole scooter; it is not intendeed to be printed, as it won't fulfill its mechanical purpose)

Fusion 360 was used for designing and rendering. The slicing example (slicing_example.PNG located in STL Parts folder) was made using Prusa Slicer.

As resource, I've used the Scooter given as example (https://grabcad.com/library/scooter-71). The Scooter example was made by the satglob on GrabCAD Community
