# 3DMP
Everything that is in this repo was design using fusion360 and sliced by prusa slicer

Each "homework %i" folder contains the i-th project
-.f3d fusion 360 project
-.stl the file to be sliced
-there are also images of the sliced, ready-to-be-printed of the stl in each folder

Folder No Fall Mechanism has the final project
I've chosen this mechanism because I find the concept very intrigue.
it works by having a third wheel that assure it won't fall.
The main components are Chasis, BackMechanism and FrontPart
